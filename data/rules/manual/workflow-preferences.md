# Task Relevance
- Focus exclusively on code directly related to the current task.
- Avoid modifying or interacting with code unrelated to the specified task.

# Testing Standards
- Implement thorough and comprehensive tests for all major functionalities.
- Ensure test coverage adequately validates intended behaviors and edge cases.

# Architecture and Patterns
- Avoid significant changes to established patterns and architecture unless explicitly instructed.
- Maintain existing proven methods unless there's clear direction to improve or refactor.

# Code Impact Awareness
- Always consider potential impacts of code changes on other areas of the codebase.
- Proactively identify and mitigate any unintended side effects or dependencies.
