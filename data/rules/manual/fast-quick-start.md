description: "FAST Element 2.0: Provides a quick start guide to using @microsoft/fast-element. It begins by showing how to install the package with npm and then creates a custom web component named <hello-world>, which combines an HTML template, CSS styles, and component logic. The example code demonstrates how to use the html tagged template literal for the componentâ€™s structure, the css tagged template literal for styling, and the FASTElement class for defining attributes and behavior. The guide concludes by explaining how to add the script to an HTML page and use the custom element in markup by referencing it with its defined tag name."

# Quick Start

## Install the package

```bash
npm install --save @microsoft/fast-element
```

## Create a web component

A web component created using FAST is comprised of 3 parts, the HTML template, the CSS styles, and the component logic. Web components can be as simple as a button, or as complex as a full page interactive experience.

To start, let's create a simple web component that combines all the necessary parts:
```typescript
import { attr, css, FASTElement, html } from "@microsoft/fast-element";

/**
 * Create an HTML template using the html tag template literal,
 * this contains interpolated text content from a passed attribute
 */
const template = html`<span>Hello ${x => x.name}!</span>`

/**
 * Create CSS styles using the css tag template literal
 */
const styles = css`
    :host {
      border: 1px solid blue;
    }

    span {
      color: red;
    }
`;

/**
 * Define your component logic by creating a class that extends
 * the FASTElement, note the addition of the attr decorator,
 * this creates an attribute on your component which can be passed.
 */
class HelloWorld extends FASTElement {
  @attr
  name: string;
}

/**
 * Define your custom web component for the browser, as soon as the file
 * containing this logic is imported, the element "hello-world" will be
 * defined in the DOM with it's html, styles, logic, and tag name.
 */
HelloWorld.define({
  name: "hello-world",
  template,
  styles,
});
```

## Add it to your project

Now that the "hello-world" custom web component has been defined, it can be included in your HTML like so:

```html
<script type="module" src="path/to/hello-world.js"></script>
<hello-world name="Earth"></hello-world>
```

It's as simple as that!
